# Extendible-hash-on-Java
Extendible hash implementation with a class of labdb. 

This is a class to simulate holding informations of the people who entered the class or left it. If a student enters the lab we enter his/her number to the system, if leaves the lab, their number is deleted. For a fast system the implementation is done by extendible hashing.

In order to make the program run, take the zip and unzip it in anywhere. Open it with a java program, I suggest using NetBeans. You need to make a main function and import Labdb to it. Have fun.
